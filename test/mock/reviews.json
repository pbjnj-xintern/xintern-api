Mentorship to me means being able to push me in the right direction when I am stuck, and at the same time encouraging me to figure out something on my own. This internship taught me how to be independent. I learned how to actually navigate source code in a large repository and understand code that I did not write. By far one of the best companies that I have interned at, in terms of becoming a better software engineer. Mozilla also flew everyone in the company to San Francisco for a work week, and we were exposed to different Mozilla products (e.g. Firefox, Rust, WebAssembly, AR/VR, etc.). Interns were also given a MacBook Pro 15\" (latest model) to take home after the internship. This is one of the best places to intern at if you are really into the web and open source (+ a lot of swags and stickers). They have a ton of people on the W3C team, if that excites you. Salary is based on your location and education (Degree, Masters/PhD). It is the same for everyone in the same category.",
